# Trailhead

This is a first part of the task that I received from n26.
It includes Batch Apex class which queries Contacts for notification and update.
I limited query with 5000 records since there is a limit on the amount of emails that could be sent from Apex class a day.
But the better solution would be a custom setting that has a field which would be refreshed every day and to use that 
custom settings throught all Apex classes to not exceed existing limit.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the second part of the task where I should have create a lightning component.
I have to admit that I underestimated my skills in Lightning components.
